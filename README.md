# Tic-tac-toe
This Python program implements a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where players take turns to enter coordinates to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full (resulting in a draw).

## Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Running the Game
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `tictactoe.py` file.
   - Run the game using the command:
     ```
     python tictactoe.py
     ```

## Game Rules
   - The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
   - Players take turns to enter coordinates in the format `row col` to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
   - Valid coordinates range from 1 to 3 for both row and column.
   - The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
   - If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game is a draw.

## Example Gameplay
   - Players enter coordinates like `1 1` to place their mark in the top-left corner, `2 2` for the center, etc.

## Additional Notes
   - This game does not include an AI opponent; it's designed for two human players taking turns.
   - Feel free to modify the code or expand features as needed.
